# vote-system
The voting system came from my Backend-Programming course lab1
With the help of Node.js, express, socket.io, the system could be used to vote for the parties.
localhost:3000 for the public to vote and to see the result
localhost:3000/admin for the admin to login with username:admin password=1234
after login, the admin could change the result of the vote.
